# Comprendre les compilateurs : plus simple qu’il n’y paraît ! - DevDay 2025

## Run

```
./serve.sh
```

## Production

- after explaining lexing and parsing:
  - switch to higher model and show different phases then zoom up again and show three phases design
    - https://aosabook.org/en/v1/llvm.html
  - diff between compiler and interpreter
    - show Java/dotnet example of hybrid VM
  - present other examples such as GCC and LLVM ?

How to go from AST to machine code?
  - Interpret (Javascript) -> slow
  - Directly -> C, C++, Go -> target achitecture
  - VM -> cross platform, just-in-time compilation, etc
